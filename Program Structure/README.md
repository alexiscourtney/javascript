JavaScript Exercises - Program Structure
=========

These are the exercises set forth in [Eloquent JavaScript] Chapter 2: Program Structure. The following exercises are included in this repository:

  - Fizz Buzz
  - Looping A Triangle



Fizz Buzz
----
>"Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

>When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5."

Looping A Triangle
----
>"Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:
```
>#
>##
>###
>####
>#####
>######
>#######
```
>"

Chess Board
----
>"Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline characters to separate >lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a “#” character. The characters should >form a chess board.

>Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
```
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
  # # # #
 ```
