Minimum
----

Recursion
----
>"We’ve seen that % (the remainder operator) can be used to test whether a number is even or odd by using % 2 to check whether it’s divisible by two. Here’s another way to define whether a positive whole number is even or odd:

>Zero is even.

>One is odd.

>For any other number N, its evenness is the same as N - 2.

>Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The function should accept a number parameter and return a Boolean."
